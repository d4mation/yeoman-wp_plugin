# yeoman-wp_plugin
Got _real_ sick of manually copy/pasting my boilerplate and forgetting to search/replace different strings.

Ensure [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) is installed globally, clone this repo, then install the dependencies. Then symlink it so you can run it anywhere.

```
npm install -g yo

npm install

npm link
```

Now from any folder, run `yo wp_plugin` to start the wizard.
